            <h2>City Council Meeting</h2>
            <small>10/06/2025</small>
            <p><strong>This is what all I took notes on for the city meeting</strong></p>
            <p>The first roughly 28 minutes they were taking pictures and stuff.</p>
            <p>The Council voted to approve a bunch of money stuff. The big things were voting yes on a new plan to issue $17.7 million in city bonds and setting aside $20 million to build a facility at the wastewater plant that will make fertilizer, which is a huge project. They also shuffled some cash around for things like storm drain work and to pay for forensic nursing services.</p>
            <p>They also made September 21st Opioid Awareness Day. They read a paper that talked about how bad the fentanyl crisis is and how the city needs to help stop people from dying. They noted that deaths from fentanyl are rising really fast and they gave a shoutout to the Tulsa Fire Department's team that goes out to help people with overdoses, gives out Narcan, and tries to get people into recovery.</p>
            <p>Finally, they said yes to a few building/land things. They approved the final plan for the Crossover Community Development and okayed a couple of requests to change zoning rules. Plus, they got rid of a $300 fee for a guy whose yard got messed up after the big 2023 Father's Day storm. The city admitted they messed up the cleanup paperwork process, so they wiped the fee. They also approved a plan to fix up a dinosaur statue at Howard Park to help with Route 66 tourism.</p>

            <h2>I made a website!!</h2>
            <small>10/06/2025</small>
            <p>Well, the requirements for Communications 7b state that I need to make a blog post about things I enjoy.. well I do enjoy making websites! But I guess in a way this isnt a post as it is hard coded into the site.. but making a full server and everything may not be the easiest thing. Its do able, but I don't feel like running my PC as a server right now, and I can't nativly port forward on my PC so like I wouldntt be able to access it from anywhere else. But anyways, lets talk about the design of this site cus like, I think its really cool. I found this style of theme somewhere else and I was like, "Ya, I love this," and so I made it! Its not 100% how I like it, and some of the CSS could still be edited for sure, but its prettty cool! and its not even that much lines either, only about 160 lines of CSS...</p>

              <div class="blog-post-text-content">
                <p>I felt like changing some things up and so I hung up my old baseball jersys because I thought it would be cool! I have to move around some of my flags I have gotten from scouts, those are over by the drum set now along with a bunch of other posters and stuff, but overall, I really love the new look of it!</p>

            <h2>Hmm.. A 3rd Blog Post</h2>
            <small>October 2, 2025</small>
            <p>Lets talk about them drums, cause I was doing really good the other nigth! I mainly play drums along with Clone hero, which is like guitar hero but better and for PCs! I had to get some special cables for it, and I had to find a way to still be able to talk on call while I'm over there so I can chat with people. I ended up taking my mic off the arm.. but that didnt work well, then I took the entire mic arm off, and tthatt worked just it took a few  minutes. As of recently I have been taking the arm out of the mount part and using a bungie cord to hang it and it works amazingly!! And the audio is all built in with the drum module, all I had to do was use VoiceMeeter to digitaly wire all the audio I need to the different sources because of the way I have things setup!</p>
